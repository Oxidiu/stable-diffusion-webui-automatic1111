All the commands:

--prompt [prompt] - (this is the command for the prompt)

--H 448 --W 448 -n_samples 1

--outdir [dir] - (this is the command for save directory)
--ddim_steps [steps] - (this is the command for the amount of steps)
--plms - (this is the command to change the samplet to plms)
--n_iter [number] (how many times to generate images)
--W [width] - (this is the command for setting image width)
--H [height] - (this is the command for setting the image height)
--n_samples - (number of images to generate at the same time)
--scale [scale] - (how close image should match the prompt)
--from-file - (this is the command to load prompts from a file)
--seed - (this is the command for setting the seed)



--RUNNING ON 4GB (And under!)--
These parameters are also useful for regular users who want to make larger images or batch sizes!
It is possible to drastically reduce VRAM usage with some modifications:

Step 1: Edit webui-user.bat
Step 2: After COMMANDLINE_ARGS= , enter your desired parameters:
Example: COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--medvram
If you have 4GB-6GB VRAM
use --medvram.
If you have 2GB VRAM,
use --lowvram
If you are getting 'Out of memory' errors on either of these, add --always-batch-cond-uncond to the other arguments

NOTES:

If you get a green/black screen instead of generated pictures, you have a card that doesn't support half precision floating point numbers (known problem on 16xx cards):
You must use --precision full --no-half in addition to other flags, and the model will take much more space in VRAM
If you are using a .vae file, you must also add --no-half-vae
Make sure to disable hardware acceleration in your browser and close anything which might be occupying VRAM if you are getting out-of-memory errors

REMEMBER TO READ THE "RUNNING ON 4GB OR UNDER" SECTION

If you are using a 1660ti 6GB RAM this is what you need to add on the webui-user.bat line (following the guide above instructions):
COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--medvram --precision full --no-half

If you are using a 1650 4GB RAM try the code above, if you get 'Out of memory' error, try this instead:
COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--lowvram --precision full --no-half
